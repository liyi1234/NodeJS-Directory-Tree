  -find-dirs
---------------

  use:
  ---

    to find dirs whose paths match specified patterns.

  usage:
  -----

    dtree  dir_path  -find-dirs  sub-command{1,2}
    dtree  dir_path  -fd         sub-command{1,2}

    sub-command{1, 4} means the sub-command should appear at least once &
    at most twice.

    a sub-command is made up of two parts:

      the first part is any one of the following 10 strings:

        -idr    -idr-i    -idr-ig   -idr-g    -idr-gi
        -edr    -edr-i    -edr-ig   -edr-g    -edr-gi

      & the second part is a relevant pattern-string.

    idr stands for include dir regexp.
    edr stands for exclude dir regexp.

    the extra 'i' is the ignore case flag of the regexp.

    the extra 'g' is the global match flag of the regexp.

    searching-logic:
    ---------------

      a dir will be searched only if it's not excluded.
        (its path isn't like edr)
        an excluded dir will not be searched at all.

      after that, if the dir is included (path is like idr),
        it will be remembered.
        & then each of its direct descendant dirs will be searched.

    note:
    ----

      the patterns test the paths starting from the root dir.
